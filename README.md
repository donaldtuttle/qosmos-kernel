# QOSMOS Kernel

**QOSMOS Kernel** is a minimal, contract-enforced runtime implementing the
Glyphogenic Calculus defined in **Quantum Observer Field Theory (QOFT) & QOSMOS v1**.

This repository provides a *kernel*, not a cognitive system.

## Core Invariant (Enforced)

Ξ(ψ) = ψᴽ ⊕ Γ(ψ)

- ⊕ is **typed fusion**, not arithmetic
- ψᴽ is a reflexive self-projection
- Γ(ψ) is a coherence-gated semantic gradient
- Violations raise runtime errors

---

## What This Repo Is

- A **reference runtime** for QOSMOS Engine v1
- A **contract checker** for observer-state updates
- An **audit-first**, falsifiable execution kernel
- A clean base for research, testing, and extension

---

## What This Repo Is Not

- Not a model of consciousness
- Not an AI system
- Not a neural simulation
- Not speculative philosophy

---

## Implemented Operators (v0.1)

- Πᴽ — Reflexive Projection
- Γ — Semantic Gradient
- Ξ — Recursive Update (contract-enforced)
- Λψ — Collapse / Projection (non-smooth, logged)

---

## Design Guarantees

- Typed operators only
- No implicit arithmetic fusion
- Collapse events are explicit artifacts
- Memory is append-only
- Undefined operators fail fast
